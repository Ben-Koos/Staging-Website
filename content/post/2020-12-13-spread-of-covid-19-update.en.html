<h3>Comparison of Cases</h3>
<p>Initially, covid spread and killed mostly in states that eventually voted for Joe Biden in 2020. The ratios in the two charts below are adjusted for population. Meaning the per capita death rate was briefly over 8:1 in April of 2020. However, though initially much worse in blue states, this ratio has steadly evened out. By December of 2020, this ratio of per capita cases in blue states to per capita cases in red states was around 1.5 and the ratio of per capita deaths was just over 2.</p>
